## 🚀 Overview

GRIDX is an AI-powered diagnostic tool for power transformer fault detection and condition monitoring. This project aims to bridge the gap between traditional SCADA threshold-based systems and modern AI diagnostics by providing explainable, actionable fault detection.

**⚠️ Development Status**: This project is currently in active development. Features and performance metrics will be updated as they are implemented and validated.

## 🎯 Planned Features

- **AI-Powered Fault Detection** using ensemble ML methods
- **Multi-modal Data Fusion** (DGA, SFRA, thermal, load data)
- **Explainable AI** integration for transparent diagnostics
- **Solution Recommendations** with maintenance suggestions
- **SCADA Integration** capability
- **Modern Web Interface** for intuitive operation

```

## 🚀 Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 18+
- Git

### Local Development
```bash
# Backend setup
cd backend
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Create environment file
copy .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration

# Start backend server
uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# Frontend setup (new terminal)
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

### Verify Setup
- Backend API: http://localhost:8000
- API Documentation: http://localhost:8000/api/docs
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000 (when implemented)

## 📊 Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current)
- [x] Project structure setup
- [x] FastAPI backend skeleton
- [x] Development environment
- [ ] Database models
- [ ] Basic API endpoints

### Phase 2: Data Pipeline
- [ ] Dataset integration (IEEE DataPort, Kaggle sources)
- [ ] Data preprocessing pipeline
- [ ] Data validation and cleaning
- [ ] Feature engineering

### Phase 3: ML Development
- [ ] Model training pipeline
- [ ] ML model comparison and selection
- [ ] Model evaluation and validation
- [ ] Explainability integration (SHAP/LIME)

### Phase 4: Web Interface
- [ ] React frontend development
- [ ] User interface design
- [ ] Real-time diagnostic interface
- [ ] Report generation system

### Phase 5: Integration & Deployment
- [ ] SCADA protocol support
- [ ] Production deployment setup
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Documentation completion

## 🔬 Research Approach

This project follows evidence-based development:
- All performance claims will be backed by empirical testing
- Model comparisons will use consistent validation methodologies
- Results will be reproducible and documented
- Code quality maintained through testing and reviews

## 🤝 Contributing

This is an active development project. Contributions welcome through:
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Implement with appropriate tests
4. Submit pull request with clear documentation

## 📊 Current Status

**Backend**: Basic FastAPI structure implemented
**Frontend**: Planned for Phase 4
**ML Pipeline**: In development
**Testing**: Unit tests being added incrementally
**Documentation**: Updated as features are completed
